            <h3>स्वराज्य एक प्रेरणा - राजमाता जिजाऊ</h3>
            <p>
                Rajmata Jijabai, as the mother of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, played a crucial role in shaping the Swarajya movement and Shivaji's life. Her unwavering support, wise counsel, and moral teachings were instrumental in instilling in Shivaji the values of justice, bravery, and respect for all religions. Jijau's influence and dedication to the cause of Swarajya inspired Shivaji to fight against the oppressive Mughal rule and establish an independent Maratha kingdom. Her love, guidance, and emotional support became the bedrock of Shivaji's successful endeavors, leaving a lasting impact on Indian history.

He imparted the best training and leadership qualities to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Shahaji's powerful and influential personality inspired Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to strive for an independent kingdom and realize the dream of a sovereign state. His leadership and capabilities were instrumental in shaping the development of Swarajya and the prosperous reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

            <h3>स्वराज्य रयतेचे राज्य - छ्त्रपती शिवाजी महाराज</h3>
            <p>
                Shivaji Maharaj's Swarajya, also known as "Rayteche Rajya" or the kingdom of farmers, was a unique and progressive concept in the history of India. He envisioned a state where the welfare of the common people, especially the farmers or "rayats," was of utmost importance. Shivaji Maharaj understood the significance of agriculture in the prosperity of the kingdom and implemented various agrarian reforms to empower farmers. He abolished unjust taxes and provided a conducive environment for agricultural growth, encouraging irrigation and crop diversification. The rayats were given ownership rights over their land, promoting a sense of security and pride. Shivaji's Swarajya emphasized social justice and equal opportunities for all, regardless of their background or caste. His approach to governance, centered around the well-being of the masses, earned him immense loyalty and support from his subjects. The concept of "Rayteche Rajya" demonstrated Shivaji Maharaj's progressive vision, where the happiness and prosperity of his people were paramount, making his reign an epitome of inclusive and people-centric governance.

            <p>
                Swarajya Rakshak Sambhaji, the eldest son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was a brave and valiant warrior who played a pivotal role in defending the Maratha kingdom. After the demise of his father, Sambhaji ascended to the throne, facing numerous challenges from external adversaries and internal dissenters. Despite facing overwhelming odds, he exhibited unwavering determination and courage in protecting Swarajya. Sambhaji led his army with great strategic acumen and valor, thwarting invasions and safeguarding the territorial integrity of the Maratha kingdom. He also showed remarkable resilience in the face of adversities, enduring harsh imprisonments and persecutions with indomitable spirit. His reign witnessed a commitment to maintaining the ideals of Swarajya, including religious tolerance and social justice. Sambhaji's sacrifices and dedication to Swarajya made him a true Rakshak (protector) of the realm, leaving an indelible mark on the history of Maharashtra and inspiring generations to come.
